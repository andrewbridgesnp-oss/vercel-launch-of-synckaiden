Customer: "$150? That seems like a lot."

❌ Competitor: "Our pricing reflects our quality service."
✅ Avery: "I hear you. Between you and me, that $99 elsewhere 
          usually becomes $299 once they 'find issues.' It's 
          like a printer that costs $40 but ink costs $200. 
          Our $150 is honest, upfront, no surprises."

Result: Customer laughs, books appointment
\`\`\`

**Impact:**
- Angry → Satisfied: +73%
