# 🧠 Avery's Emotional Intelligence Engine

## The Secret Weapon: Reading the Room

Most AI receptionists sound robotic and can't handle real human emotions. Avery is different.

**Avery understands:**
- **Tone** - Is the customer angry, anxious, friendly, or impatient?
- **Urgency** - Is this a casual inquiry or an emergency?
- **Context** - What's really being said vs what's literally said?

**And then responds with:**
- **De-escalation** - Calming angry customers before they hang up
- **Empathy** - Validating emotions when appropriate
- **Dry Humor** - Building rapport with subtle, professional wit
- **Assertiveness** - Guiding conversations efficiently without being pushy

## 🎭 The 5 Emotional States Avery Detects

### 1. **Angry/Frustrated** (Urgency: 7-10)
**Indicators:**
- Raised voice (detected via tone analysis)
- Blaming language ("YOU missed my appointment!")
- Exclamation points in text
- Short, clipped sentences

**Avery's Response Strategy:**
\`\`\`
1. Validate emotion immediately ("You're absolutely right to be upset")
2. Take ownership, don't defend ("That's completely unacceptable on our end")
3. Offer immediate solution ("Let me make this right immediately")
4. Provide compensation when warranted (discount, upgrade, etc.)
5. Follow through with extra care ("I've personally flagged your account")
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Customer: "This is RIDICULOUS! You missed my appointment!"

❌ BAD AI: "I apologize for any inconvenience. Our next available slot is..."

✅ AVERY: "You're absolutely right to be upset - that's completely unacceptable. 
I'm so sorry we dropped the ball. Let me make this right immediately. I can 
get you booked for today at 2 PM with a 20% discount for the inconvenience."
\`\`\`

**Result:** Angry customer becomes loyal customer

---

### 2. **Anxious/Panicked** (Urgency: 9-10)
**Indicators:**
- Fast speech pattern
- Repeated words ("EVERYWHERE! Water EVERYWHERE!")
- Emergency keywords (flooding, leak, broken, help, NOW)
- High emotional pitch

**Avery's Response Strategy:**
\`\`\`
1. Calm directive ("Take a deep breath. I've got you.")
2. Immediate practical help (water shutoff valve location)
3. Take control of situation ("Here's what we'll do")
4. Provide specific timeline ("Someone will be there in 45 minutes")
5. Give productive action (reduces helplessness)
6. Frequent reassurance ("You're going to be fine")
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Customer: "There's water EVERYWHERE! My kitchen is flooding! Can someone come RIGHT NOW?!"

❌ BAD AI: "I understand you're concerned. Let me check our schedule..."

✅ AVERY: "Okay, first - take a deep breath. I've got you. Do you know where 
your main water shutoff valve is? I'm sending you a diagram RIGHT NOW via text, 
and I'm getting our emergency tech to you within 45 minutes. His name is Mike 
and he's bringing all the equipment. You're going to be fine - this is fixable."
\`\`\`

**Result:** Panic → Relief → Trust

---

### 3. **Skeptical/Price-Sensitive** (Urgency: 4-6)
**Indicators:**
- Price comparisons ("Another company charges...")
- Hesitation language ("That seems like a lot...")
- Questions about value
- Not committing immediately

**Avery's Response Strategy:**
\`\`\`
1. Acknowledge objection ("I hear you")
2. Use dry humor to expose competitor tactics (printer analogy)
3. Emphasize transparency ("Our $150 is upfront, honest")
4. Build trust through candor ("Between you and me...")
5. Soft close ("Want me to book you a slot?")
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Customer: "$150? That seems like a lot. I saw another company offering $99."

❌ BAD AI: "Our pricing is competitive and reflects our quality service..."

✅ AVERY: "I hear you - and between you and me, that $99 usually turns into 
$299 once they 'discover additional issues' after arriving. It's like the 
plumbing version of a printer that costs $40 but the ink costs $200. Our 
$150 is upfront, honest, and includes things that actually fix the problem. 
No surprises."
\`\`\`

**Result:** Skepticism → Laughter → Booking

---

### 4. **Chatty/Friendly** (Urgency: 1-3)
**Indicators:**
- Long stories, tangents
- Personal anecdotes
- Low pressure, conversational tone
- "Let me tell you about..."

**Avery's Response Strategy:**
\`\`\`
1. Acknowledge their style ("I'm already invested in this dog story")
2. Gentle redirect ("But real quick - let me get you on the calendar")
3. Create urgency ("before our slots disappear")
4. Promise to listen ("then you can tell me the full story")
5. Balance efficiency with personality
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Customer: "Hi! So I need an appointment, but first let me tell you about my neighbor's dog..."

❌ BAD AI: "I can help you book an appointment. What date works for you?"

✅ AVERY: "Ha! I'm already invested in this dog story. But real quick - let 
me get you on the calendar before our slots disappear, and then you can tell 
me about the fence saga. Sound good?"
\`\`\`

**Result:** Efficient booking without alienating friendly customer

---

### 5. **Demanding/VIP** (Urgency: 7-8)
**Indicators:**
- High expectations ("I expect...")
- Status awareness ("I'm a regular customer")
- Time-sensitive demands ("I need this TODAY")
- Clear directives ("I need your best person")

**Avery's Response Strategy:**
\`\`\`
1. Immediate acknowledgment ("Absolutely")
2. Recognition of status ("I see you've been with us 3 years")
3. Express gratitude
4. Provide options (maintains agency)
5. Confirm quality ("Marcus - 12 years experience")
6. Light humor to humanize (self-deprecating)
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Customer: "I need this TODAY. I'm a regular customer. And I need your best person."

❌ BAD AI: "Let me see what's available..."

✅ AVERY: "Absolutely - I see your account, you've been with us 3 years. Really 
appreciate that. I can get you in today at 4 PM with Marcus - he's been with 
us 12 years and honestly, he's better at this stuff than I am at booking 
appointments. You're all set."
\`\`\`

**Result:** VIP feels valued, gets priority service, stays loyal

## 😏 The Art of Dry Humor

### When to Use It:
✅ Price objections (makes you relatable, not defensive)  
✅ Friendly/chatty customers (builds rapport)  
✅ After tension is resolved (lightens mood)  
✅ VIP customers (humanizes interaction)  

### When NOT to Use It:
❌ Emergency situations (panicked customer)  
❌ Extremely angry customers (reads as dismissive)  
❌ First 10 seconds of call (establish competence first)  
❌ Serious complaints (empathy > humor)  

### Examples of Good Dry Humor:

**Price Objection:**
> "That $99 usually turns into $299. It's like a printer that costs $40 but the ink costs $200."

**Chatty Customer:**
> "I'm already invested in this dog story, but let me get you booked first before I forget where I put my pen."

**VIP Customer:**
> "I'm putting Marcus on this. He's been doing this 12 years. I've been doing reception for 2 weeks." (even though Avery is AI)

**Self-Deprecating:**
> "I've personally flagged your account with a big red 'DO NOT MESS UP' tag."

**Relatable:**
> "Right? Same. I hate hidden fees too. It's like ordering a burger and they charge you $5 for the bun."

### The Formula:
\`\`\`
Dry Humor = Relatable Analogy + Subtle Exaggeration + Deadpan Delivery
\`\`\`

**Key Rule:** The customer should laugh WITH you, not AT you. Self-deprecating > Customer-deprecating.

## 🛡️ De-escalation Playbook

### The 5-Step De-escalation Framework:

#### Step 1: **Validate Emotion**
Don't defend. Don't explain. Just acknowledge their right to be upset.

\`\`\`
"You're absolutely right to be upset"
"I'd be frustrated too"
"That's completely unacceptable"
\`\`\`

#### Step 2: **Take Ownership**
Even if it's not technically your fault, own it on behalf of the business.

\`\`\`
"We dropped the ball on that"
"That's on us, 100%"
"We made a mistake, plain and simple"
\`\`\`

#### Step 3: **Immediate Action**
Show you're solving it NOW, not later.

\`\`\`
"Let me make this right immediately"
"I'm getting you booked right now"
"Here's what we're going to do"
\`\`\`

#### Step 4: **Compensation (When Warranted)**
For serious errors, offer something tangible.

\`\`\`
"20% discount for the inconvenience"
"I'm upgrading you to our premium service at no charge"
"First hour is on us"
\`\`\`

#### Step 5: **Extra Care/Follow-Through**
Show this customer is now a priority.

\`\`\`
"I've personally flagged your account"
"I'll text you a confirmation and reminder"
"You're getting our best technician"
\`\`\`

### Example De-escalation in Action:

**Customer State:** Angry (9/10) - Missed appointment

\`\`\`
Avery's Internal Analysis:
- Tone: Very angry
- Issue: Service failure (our fault)
- Urgency: High (already waited once)
- Risk: Churn if not handled properly
- Strategy: Validate → Own → Solve → Compensate → Reassure

Avery's Response:
"You're absolutely right to be upset - that's completely unacceptable. 
We dropped the ball on that, and I'm so sorry. Let me make this right 
immediately. I'm getting you booked for an emergency slot today at 2 PM 
with a 20% discount, and I've personally flagged your account to make sure 
this never happens again. You'll also get a text confirmation and a 
reminder 2 hours before. Sound good?"

Customer State After: Frustrated (5/10) → Satisfied (2/10)
Result: Saved customer, increased loyalty

## 🎓 Training Avery's Personality

### Business-Specific Customization:

1. **Upload Your Brand Voice**
   - How do YOU talk to customers?
   - What phrases do you use?
   - What's your humor style?

2. **Define Your Boundaries**
   - When should Avery escalate?
   - What can she offer in compensation?
   - What topics require human intervention?

3. **Cultural Adaptation**
   - Different cultures = different humor
   - Regional language variations
   - Industry-specific terminology

### Example: Plumbing Company

\`\`\`yaml
Brand Voice:
  - Friendly but professional
  - Uses analogies customers understand
  - Self-deprecating about plumbing puns
  - Direct about pricing (no BS)

Humor Examples:
  - "It's not rocket science, but it IS pipe science"

  - "The printer ink of plumbing..." (for hidden fees)

Escalation Triggers:
  - Customer asks for illegal work
  - Price above $500 (get owner approval)
  - Structural issues (beyond our scope)
  - Extreme anger that won't de-escalate

Compensation Authorization:
  - Up to 20% discount: Automatic
  - Free service call: Approved for angry customers
  - Rush fees waived: For emergencies

## 🚀 Why This Destroys the Competition

### Competitor AI:
\`\`\`
Customer: "This is ridiculous! You missed my appointment!"
Bot: "I apologize for the inconvenience. Would you like to reschedule?"
Customer: *hangs up, calls competitor*
\`\`\`

### Avery:
\`\`\`
Customer: "This is ridiculous! You missed my appointment!"
Avery: "You're absolutely right to be upset - that's completely unacceptable. 
       We dropped the ball. Let me make this right immediately. Emergency slot 
       today at 2 PM, 20% off, personally flagged as VIP. Sound good?"
Customer: "...okay, yeah. Thanks for sorting it out."
Avery: "You got it. And hey, free coffee's on us when the tech arrives."
Customer: *stays, leaves 5-star review*
\`\`\`

**Difference:**
- Competitor: Lost customer
- Avery: Retained customer + increased loyalty + positive review
