- Extensive disclaimers on every calculation
- Terms of Service reviewed by counsel (post-launch)

**Risk:** Users might sue if deal goes bad.

**Mitigation:**
- Liability limitations in Terms of Service

### Market Risk
**Risk:** Not enough demand for niche product.

## 💬 BANKER Q&A PREP

### Financial Questions
**Q:** How do you plan to acquire customers?
**A:** Agent referrals (free) + content marketing (organic) + paid ads ($50 CAC). Blended CAC target: $30.

**Q:** What's your churn rate assumption?
**A:** 5% monthly initially. Users churn after closing their deal. Will add "portfolio mode" for repeat buyers and investors.

**Q:** Why would agents refer instead of building their own tool?
**A:** They're too busy. Plus, our 20% commission is passive income. Building software requires $100k+ investment.

### Technical Questions
**Q:** What if a competitor copies you?
**A:** They'd need: (1) development team ($200k+), (2) compliance expertise, (3) agent network, (4) 6-12 months. We'll have network effects by then.

**Q:** Can the platform handle 100,000 users?
**A:** Yes. Architecture is designed for scale. Current bottleneck is database queries - solved with caching and optimization ($5k engineering work).

### Legal Questions
**Q:** Are you a mortgage broker?
**A:** No. We're software. Like TurboTax isn't a CPA. We provide education and organization, not financial advice or loan origination.

**Q:** What if someone sues because deal failed?
**A:** Our Terms of Service limit liability to fees paid (max $99). We carry E&O insurance. Our disclaimers are extensive.
