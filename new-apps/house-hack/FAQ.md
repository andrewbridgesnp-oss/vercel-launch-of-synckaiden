# KAIDEN HouseHack 203K - Frequently Asked Questions

## 🏠 ABOUT THE PLATFORM

### What is KAIDEN HouseHack 203K?
A complete SaaS platform that guides buyers through FHA 203(k) renovation loans for 1-4 unit house-hacking properties. Think TurboTax for FHA 203(k) deals - step-by-step guidance, calculators, team collaboration, and deal management.

### Who is this for?
- **First-time home buyers** exploring house-hacking with FHA 203(k) loans
- **Real estate investors** buying 2-4 unit properties with renovation financing
- **Real estate agents** helping clients navigate 203(k) deals
- **Loan officers** managing 203(k) loan pipelines
- **203(k) consultants** coordinating rehab projects
- **Contractors** bidding on 203(k) renovation work

### What's house-hacking?
Buying a 2-4 unit property, living in one unit, and renting the others. Rental income offsets (or covers) your mortgage, reducing your housing expense. FHA 203(k) lets you buy AND renovate with one loan and only 3.5% down.

### Is this a mortgage lender?
**No.** We're an educational platform and organizational tool. We don't lend money, provide specific rate quotes, or guarantee loan approval. You'll work with your own FHA-approved lender.

## 🎓 EDUCATIONAL DISCLAIMERS

### Do you guarantee I'll get approved for a loan?
**No.** Loan approval depends on your credit, income, debt-to-income ratio, property condition, and lender-specific policies. We provide educational guidance, not approval guarantees.

### Are your calculators accurate?
Our calculators use industry-standard formulas and HUD guidelines, but results are **estimates only**. Actual costs may vary based on:
- Interest rates (market fluctuates daily)
- Property taxes (vary by county)
- Insurance costs (vary by property and provider)
- Rehab estimates (contractor quotes may differ)

**Always verify** with licensed lenders, appraisers, and contractors.

### Can I trust the FHA loan limits?
We update loan limits annually when HUD publishes new data (typically December). Limits shown are current as of January 2026. High-cost areas may have higher limits. Always verify with your lender.

### Is this financial advice?
**No.** This platform is an educational tool and organizational software. It is NOT financial, legal, or tax advice. Consult licensed professionals (mortgage lenders, attorneys, CPAs) before making financial decisions.

---

## 🗺️ GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE

### What states do you support?
**All 50 U.S. states + Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam.**

### Do FHA loan limits vary by location?
Yes. Limits vary by county based on median home prices. We include county-specific limits for all 3,143 U.S. counties. High-cost areas (like San Francisco, NYC) have higher limits.

### Can I use this for properties outside the U.S.?
No. FHA loans are only available for properties in the United States and its territories.

## 📊 AGENT REFERRAL PROGRAM

### How does the agent commission system work?
Real estate agents can sign up for an agent account and receive a unique referral code. When clients sign up using that code and upgrade to a paid plan, the agent earns **20% recurring commission** on that customer's subscription.

**Example:**
- Client upgrades to Pro plan ($29/mo)
- Agent earns $5.80/month as long as client stays subscribed
- 10 clients on Pro = $58/month passive income

### Who can become an agent?
Licensed real estate agents (realtors, brokers) with active licenses. You'll need to verify your license during signup.

### When do agents get paid?
Commissions accrue monthly and are paid within 15 days of month-end. Minimum payout threshold is $50. Agents need to provide tax information (W-9) to receive payments.

### Is this legal under RESPA?
Yes. Agents are being compensated for referring clients to our **software platform**, not to specific lenders (which would violate RESPA). This is a standard referral fee arrangement.

### Can agents lose their commission?
Commissions may be forfeited if:
- Fraudulent referrals are detected
- Agent license is suspended or revoked
- Agent violates our Terms of Service
- Client requests refund for service issues we caused
