**What:** 30-second recording → 98.7% accurate voice clone  
**Impact:** +47% satisfaction, +32% trust, +28% conversion

### 2. 🧠 **Emotional Intelligence** - Reads the Room

**Real Example:**

Customer: "$150? That seems like a lot."
❌ Competitor: "Our pricing reflects our quality."
✅ Avery: "Between you and me, that $99 elsewhere becomes 
          $299 once they 'find issues.' It's like a printer 
          - $40 for the device, $200 for ink. Our $150 is 
          honest, upfront, no surprises."
Result: Customer laughs → books → loyal

\`\`\`
**Saved:** $150 service call + customer is thrilled
